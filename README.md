### Hello 👋

### About me
I am a senior at Northwestern University. My major is Integrated Engineering Studies, which allows me to customize my own class in the area of computational biology. I am applying to computational biology PhD programs in fall 2023, and I am very excited about contributing more to the academic world in the coming years!

In the long term, I would like to be a computational biologist, hopefully specialized in the field of Immunology 🧬

### Life outside of coding
- I love baking! You won't be dissapointed by my butter cookies:)👩🏻‍🍳
- I also love learning new languages (and also the culture of different countries). Currently, I am trying to brush up on latin and greek 🏛 and am also learning japanese 🇯🇵 and spanish 🇪🇸.
